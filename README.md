### Technologies used:

-Bootstrap    
 -SQL
-Java
-JPA
-AWS

### Overview:
This project was built from and empty page to what it is now. I still did not have enough time to add all the features I wanted but I feel this is a good base for me to return. The setup was most important in my mind, if my components weren’t talking to each other properly then I’m in trouble before I even really started. After test were run to ensure my DAO was talking to my database and controller talking to the JSP and DAO I started to form methods to query the database for certain aspects of my entity. This took a good bit of time because anytime I wanted to implement a new method or select new data from database, it has to be done in DAO, Controller and finally displayed on the JSP. I had a very love hate relationship with my CSS and getting everything how I wanted and still did not get to everything. I throughly enjoyed this project as I got to build something of my choice. I think so far this is my best work yet. This required the use of all my skills I have earned so far and a good bit of stack overflow.



### Lessons learned:

-CSS is an animal in itself, tweaking was exhausting bu ti learned maybe new ways to do things and just strengthen my skills overall.
-One small issue in your DAO will can make it seem like nothing is happening, I was adding to the database but not showing for awhile due to a small issue in my DAO.
-I can very easily see how being on a team will allow your site to be bigger and better as we;; as  done much quicker.
-Stack Overflow is now my best friend.
